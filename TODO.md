# Tasks to do

1. add a `init` option which creates a `.tatum` directory containing config files, and automatically create one config
2. make a `new` option which makes a new template directory with a `page.html`
3. make a `render-all` option which reads a config file for files to render and output them to a directory. would be useful when exporting certain notes to a different repo
